  - Ah, greetings, traveler. I sense great potential in you.
  - Hmm... I seem to have misplaced a rather *critical* potion inside the dungeon.
  - I was conducting an experiment, and... well, portals can be tricky.
  - If you ever wander inside, perhaps you could recover it for me?
  - I promise a magical reward, should you succeed.
